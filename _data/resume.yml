    I own the internal dashboard of this video IT training company. I also maintain the React/Node application that all employees use to submit their required monthly training. My duties include the supervision of updates brought to the dashboard by fellow developers, such as major modifications to DynamoDB tables and the addition of new tools to the app.


    I participated to the modernization of Studio, the application used by in-house trainers to publish content to the CBT Nuggets platform. This project included updates to various Node microservices, the creation of a GraphQL server, as well as the implementation of an Apollo client in React.

    I was hired by this 4-person company to rewrite the core application of Local Food Marketplace from Visual Basic to .NET.


    As a result, I developed Grow, a platform that helps producers manage the sales, harvest, and distribution of their produce to retail and wholesale clients.


    I also created new modules such as inventory and CSA management. Subscriptions to these modules significantly increased the revenue of Local Food Marketplace.
